## Part 1: Data

The data comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an observational study conducted in all 50 states in the US and participating US territories.  The population of interest are non-institutionalized adults aged 18+ living in the United States or participating territories.

Data is collected by surveying randomly selected adults from households contacted via a landline; or, cellular phone users that reside in a private residence or student housing at a college or university.  This study is observational, and therefore no causal relationships can be inferred from this data.  In addition, the sample population is limited a bit to the subset of the stated population that have either a landline or celular phone.

There are many potential problems with the data collection.  Certain population segments may be less likely to answer their phone, or may be at home less and therefore unable to be sampled.  In addition, the proportion of samples from each state is not in line with the proportion of the the total US population for each state.  Therefore certain states and / or regions may be over or under sampled within the data.

## Part 2: Research questions

I'm interested in how the dominant political view within states associates with the health and frequency of routine health care of the state's military veterans.  States will be typed into two classes - red or blue.  Red states will be defined as states that Mitt Romney carried in the 2012 presidential election, and blue states will be those carried by Barak Obama.  Since Guam and Puerto Rico do not vote in the presidential election, I will exclude them from my analysis.

I will first look at how general health between veterans and non-veterans differ by state type.  Second, I will look at how frequency of routine health care varies between veterans and non-veterans by state type.

Members of the US military have been encouraged to smoke tobacco.  Cigarettes were part of K anc C ration kits throughout the 2nd world war [http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/7/3/219].  My third question will look at the association of respondents who have been diagnosed with a heart attack with smokers and non-smokers among veterans and non-veterans.

**Research quesion 1:**

For respondents reporting on their general health, are there assocations between veteran status or the political leaning of the respondent's state in the reported quality of health?

**Research quesion 2:**

Is there an association between veteran status or the political leaning of the respondent's state in the frequency of routine health care?

**Research quesion 3:**

Are being a veteran and smoking more than 100 cigarettes associated with being diagnosed with a heart attack?

## Part 3: Exploratory data analysis

First, I will create a new data frame with only the features I'll need for my analysis.  I'll also get rid of any rows with N/A values.

```{r}

# select columns I want for my questions

# State column 1
# Veteran column 45
# Time since checkup 26
# General Health 19
# Smoker 68
# Heart Attack 33

# list of columns I want

list<-c(1,19,26,33,45,68)

# create new dataframe with only the columns I want

mydata<-brfss2013[,list]

# Use complete.cases to get rid of N/As

completes<-complete.cases(mydata)

mydata<-mydata[completes,]

# dimensions of data frame with N/A removed

dim(mydata)


```

I have 466,472 observaions of 6 features.  I now need to classify each state as either red or blue and add that into my dataframe.  This data is from 2013, so I will use the results of the 2012 presidential election to classify the states.  Red states will be those that went to Mitt Romney and blue state will be those that went to Barak Obama.

```{r}
# pull out states to classify as red or blue

states<-mydata %>%
  group_by(X_state) %>%
  summarize()

# write out states to append "Blue" or "Red" status
# write.csv(states, "matchstates.csv")

# Read in state data with state Type added:

statejoin<-read.csv("matchstates.csv")

# Convert X_state to character to facilitate join

mydata$X_state<-as.character(mydata$X_state)

statejoin$X_state<-as.character(statejoin$X_state)

# Use inner join to add "Type" column to mydata

mydata<-inner_join(mydata, statejoin)

# convert factors to numeric

mydata$genhlth<-as.numeric(mydata$genhlth)

mydata$checkup1<-as.numeric(mydata$checkup1)

# quick peek at table

head(mydata)
```

Now that I've got the data set together, I'll move on to the research questions.

**Research quesion 1:**

For respondents reporting on their general health, are there assocations between veteran status or the political leaning of the respondent's state in the reported quality of health?

I'll first select the features of interest for this questions and look at some summary statistics:

```{r}
# Select data to work on question 1

sum1<- mydata %>%
  select(genhlth, veteran3, Type) %>%
  group_by(Type, veteran3) %>%
  summarise(Q1=quantile(genhlth, .25), Mean=mean(genhlth), Median=median(genhlth),
            Q3=quantile(genhlth, .75), IQR=IQR(genhlth), StDev=sd(genhlth)) %>%
  mutate(Skew=ifelse(Mean>Median, "Right", "Left"))

head(sum1)


```

We can see that the spread and variation are similar for all four scenarios.  However, there is variation in the mean, median and skew of the distributions.  Veterans in blue states are the only group with a right skew, indicating that more of their general health values are less than the mean of 2.5.  It is also interesting to see that the average general health values for veterans are higher than non-veterans in both blue and red states.  This indicates an positive association with higher reported health status and being a veteran

The histograms below show how the data is distributed for all four groups:

```{r}
# Non Veteran histogram data

p1dat<-mydata %>%
  select(genhlth, veteran3, Type) %>%
  filter(veteran3=="No")

# Veteran histogram data

p2dat<-mydata %>%
  select(genhlth, veteran3, Type) %>%
  filter(veteran3=="Yes")

# Histogram of non-Veterans

p1<-ggplot(p1dat, aes(genhlth, fill=Type))+geom_histogram(binwidth = .5)+
  facet_grid(.~Type)+scale_fill_manual(values=c("#00008b", "#ff0000"))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(p1dat$genhlth), color="black")+
  ggtitle("General Health Value by State Type for non - Veterans")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="State Type"))+
  ylab("Count of Respondents") + xlab("Reported General Health Value")

p1

# Histogram of veterans

p2<-ggplot(p2dat, aes(genhlth, fill=Type))+geom_histogram(binwidth = .5)+
  facet_grid(.~Type)+scale_fill_manual(values=c("#00008b", "#ff0000"))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(p2dat$genhlth), color="black")+
  ggtitle("General Health Value by State Type for Veterans")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="State Type"))+
  ylab("Count of Respondents") + xlab("Reported General Health Value")

p2

```




**Research quesion 2:**

Is there an association between veteran status or the political leaning of the respondent's state in the frequency of routine health care?

Again, I'll organize the data required and look at the summary statistics:

```{r}

sum2<- mydata %>%
  select(checkup1, veteran3, Type) %>%
  group_by(Type, veteran3) %>%
  summarise(Q1=quantile(checkup1, .25), Mean=mean(checkup1), Median=median(checkup1),
            Q3=quantile(checkup1, .75), IQR=IQR(checkup1), StDev=sd(checkup1)) %>%
  mutate(Skew=ifelse(Mean>Median, "Right", "Left"))

head(sum2)

```

Again, We see that the spread and variation are similar for all four scenarios.  There is some variation in the distributions based on the means and IQR.  All four distributions are right skewed, indicating that there are more respondents indicating more frequent basic medical care than the mean value.  In both red and blue states, there appears to be a positive association between veteran status and the frequency of routine medical care.

These histograms show the distribution for each of the four groups:

```{r}
# Question 2 data

p3dat<-mydata %>%
  select(checkup1, veteran3, Type) %>%
  filter(veteran3=="No")

p4dat<-mydata %>%
  select(checkup1, veteran3, Type) %>%
  filter(veteran3=="Yes")

# Histogram of non-Veterans

p3<-ggplot(p3dat, aes(checkup1, fill=Type))+geom_histogram(binwidth = .5)+
  facet_grid(.~Type)+scale_fill_manual(values=c("#00008b", "#ff0000"))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(p3dat$checkup1), color="black")+
  ggtitle("Time Since last Checkup by State Type for non - Veterans")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="State Type"))+
  ylab("Count of Respondents") + xlab("Reported Frequency of Routine Health Care")
  

p3

# Histogram of veterans

p4<-ggplot(p4dat, aes(checkup1, fill=Type))+geom_histogram(binwidth = .5)+
  facet_grid(.~Type)+scale_fill_manual(values=c("#00008b", "#ff0000"))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(p4dat$checkup1), color="black")+
  ggtitle("Time Since last Checkup by State Type for Veterans")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="State Type"))+
  ylab("Count of Respondents") + xlab("Reported Frequency of Routine Health Care")
  

p4

```


**Research quesion 3:**

Is being a veteran and smoking more than 100 cigarettes associated with being diagnosed with a heart attack?

Here is a table of the heart attack rates of veteran and non-veteran smokers and non-smokers:


```{r}

sum3<- mydata %>%
  select(cvdinfr4, veteran3, smoke100) %>%
  group_by(veteran3, smoke100, cvdinfr4) %>%
  summarise(Sum=n()) %>%
  spread(cvdinfr4, Sum) %>%
  mutate(Sum = Yes+No, `PctYes` = round(Yes/Sum*100, digits =1))

head(sum3)

```

The data show a positive association between being a veteran and being diagnosed with a heart attach for both smokers and non-smokers.  As shown in the chart below, non-smoking veterans report being diagnosed with heart attacks at a higher rate than smokers who are not veterans.

```{r}
levels(sum3$veteran3)<-c("Veteran", "Non-Veteran")
p5<-ggplot(sum3, aes(smoke100))+
  geom_bar(aes(weight=PctYes, fill=veteran3))+
  facet_grid(.~veteran3)+scale_fill_manual(values=c("#00008b", "#ff0000"))+
  ylab("% Diagnosed with Heart Attacks")+xlab("Have Smoked at Least 100 Cigarettes")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL))

p5

```

**Summary**

We find with our first question a positive association between reported general health and being a veteran.  There also is a positive association between living in a red state and better reported general health.

With the second question, we find a positive association between living in a blue state and more frequent routine health care.  We also find a positive association between being a veteran and more frequent routine health care.

The results of the first two questions are intriguing.  Residents of blue states report lower general health;, but more frequent routine health care.  Do they go to the doctor more often because of poor health?  Or, does more frequent care diagnose more issues, which in turn might be associated with lower reported health scores?

The third question shows a positive association with being a veteran and being diagnosed with a heart attack.  Non-smoking veterans actually reported being diagnosed with a heart attack more often than smoking non-veterans.  There is also a clear positive association with being diagnosed with a heart attack and being a smoker.
